 In order to view DGN file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with any Viewer. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to view the DGN file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DGN file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method with object of TiffOptions
1.  Call Process.Start with path to resultant image to load it in default application

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

string output = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".tiff";

// load DGN file in an instance of Image
using (Aspose.CAD.Image image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dgn"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions
    Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions();
    rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1200;
    rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1200;

    // create an instance of TiffOptions for the resultant image
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.TiffOptions(Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums.TiffExpectedFormat.Default);

    // set VectorRasterizationOptions property
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // save DGN as TIFF image
    image.Save(output, options);
}
// load resultant TIFF image in default application
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.CAD for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. ‎

DGN, Design, files are drawings created by and supported by CAD applications such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It is used for creating and saving designs for construction projects such as highways, bridges, and buildings. The format is similar to Autodesk's DWG file format and is considered its competitor. DNG files can either be saved as Intergraph Standard File Format or V8 DGN. DGN can be converted to several other formats such as DWG, BMP, JPEG, PDF, GIF and others. It can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD, Bentley View and Bentley Systems MicroStation in addition to other software applications such as Corel PaintShop Photo Pro and IMSI TurboCAD Deluxe versions.
