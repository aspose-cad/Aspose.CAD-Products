 In order to view IFC file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with any Viewer. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to view the IFC file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IFC file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method with object of TiffOptions
1.  Call Process.Start with path to resultant image to load it in default application

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

string output = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".tiff";

// load IFC file in an instance of Image
using (Aspose.CAD.Image image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.ifc"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions
    Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions();
    rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1200;
    rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1200;

    // create an instance of TiffOptions for the resultant image
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.TiffOptions(Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums.TiffExpectedFormat.Default);

    // set VectorRasterizationOptions property
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // save IFC as TIFF image
    image.Save(output, options);
}
// load resultant TIFF image in default application
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.CAD for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. ‎

Files with IFC extension refer to  Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format that establishes international standards to import and export building objects and their properties. This file format provides interoperability between different software applications. Specifications for this file format are developed and maintained by buildingSMART International as its Data Standard. The ultimate objective of IFC file format is to improve communication, productivity, delivery time and quality throughout the life cycle of a building. Due to the established standards for common objects in the building industry, it reduces the loss of information during transmission from one application to another. IFC can hold data for geometry, calculation, quantities, facility management, pricing etc. for many different professions (architect, electrical, HVAC, structural, terrain etc.).
