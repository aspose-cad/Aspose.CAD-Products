 In order to view STL file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with any Viewer. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to view the STL file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load STL file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method with object of TiffOptions
1.  Call Process.Start with path to resultant image to load it in default application

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Aspose.CAD for .NET is supported on all major operating systems. Just make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET referenced in your project

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

string output = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".tiff";

// load STL file in an instance of Image
using (Aspose.CAD.Image image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.stl"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions
    Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions();
    rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1200;
    rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1200;

    // create an instance of TiffOptions for the resultant image
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.TiffOptions(Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums.TiffExpectedFormat.Default);

    // set VectorRasterizationOptions property
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // save STL as TIFF image
    image.Save(output, options);
}
// load resultant TIFF image in default application
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.CAD for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. ‎

STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.
