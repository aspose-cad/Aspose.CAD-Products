 In order to view DXF file, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with any Viewer. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to view the DXF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DXF file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method with object of TiffOptions
1.  Call Process.Start with path to resultant image to load it in default application

```cs

string output = System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".tiff";

// load DXF file in an instance of Image
using (Aspose.CAD.Image image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dxf"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions
    Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions();
    rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 1200;
    rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 1200;

    // create an instance of TiffOptions for the resultant image
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.TiffOptions(Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums.TiffExpectedFormat.Default);

    // set VectorRasterizationOptions property
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // save DXF as TIFF image
    image.Save(output, options);
}
// load resultant TIFF image in default application
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(output);

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. вЂЋ

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
