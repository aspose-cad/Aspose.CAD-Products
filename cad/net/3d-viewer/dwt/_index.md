In order to view DWT file, we’ll use
[Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

You need the
 [aspose.cad.dll](https://downloads.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 to try the following workflow in your own environment.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Load DWT file with Image.Load method
+  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height and width
+  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
+  Call Image.Save method with object of TiffOptions
+  Call Process.Start with path to resultant image to load it in default application
+  Save image to disc in DWT format

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.CAD for .NET API" %}}


Aspose.CAD API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

A DWT file is an AutoCAD drawing template file that is used as starter for creating drawings that can be saved as DWG files. Such template files provide initial settings such as unit types, precision required, title blocks, layer names, line types and other similar information for lateral conversion to proper drawing files. Both AutoCAD and CoreCAD can be used to read the template files and utilize them further. In simple words, a DWT is a DWG with pre-defined read-only attributes in the same way as a MSWord DOT file is to a DOC file.
