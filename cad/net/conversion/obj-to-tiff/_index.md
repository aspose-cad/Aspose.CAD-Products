 In order to convert OBJ to TIFF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.CAD 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert OBJ files to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load OBJ file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of TiffOptions

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OBJ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}
OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="tiff" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/" >}}
TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
