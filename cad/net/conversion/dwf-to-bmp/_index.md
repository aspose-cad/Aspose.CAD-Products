 In order to convert DWF to BMP, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.CAD 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert DWF files to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWF file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of BmpOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of BmpOptions

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows DWF to BMP C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load DWF in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Image.Load("template.dwf"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of BmpOptions
    var options = new ImageOptions.BmpOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DWF to BMP
    image.Save("output.bmp", options);
}

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DWF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwf/" >}}
Design Web Format (DWF) represents 2D/3D drawing in compressed format for viewing, reviewing or printing design files. It contains graphics and text as part of design data and reduce the size of the file due to its compressed format. The reduced file size makes the distribution and communication of rich design data efficient. DWF doesn't require the recipient to know about the usage of CAD software that created the original drawing. The contents of DWF file format can be simple and include just a single sheet or complex enough to have fonts, color, and images.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="bmp" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
