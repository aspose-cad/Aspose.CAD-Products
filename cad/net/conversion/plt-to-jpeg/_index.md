The PLT file format is a vector-based plotter file introduced by Autodesk, Inc. and contains information for a certain CAD file. Plotting details require accuracy and precision in production, and usage of PLT file guarantee this as all images are printed using lines instead of dots. The format is based on the HPGL file format which is used for sending information to plotter printers. PLT files can be viewed with its original applications i.e. Autodesk's AutoCAD, but there are other applications as well that can be used to manipulate these files such as CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. A number of applications and APIs support conversion of PLT file format to DXF, PDF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, CGM, SVG, PS and PCL.

    {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
