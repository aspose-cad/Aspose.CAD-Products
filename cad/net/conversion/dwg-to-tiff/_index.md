 In order to convert DWG to TIFF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.CAD 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert DWG files to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWG file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of TiffOptions

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows DWG to TIFF C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load DWG in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Image.Load("template.dwg"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of TiffOptions
    var options = new ImageOptions.TiffOptions(Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums.TiffExpectedFormat.Default);

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DWG to TIFF
    image.Save("output.tiff", options);
}

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DWG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwg/" >}}
Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk's free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="tiff" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/" >}}
TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
