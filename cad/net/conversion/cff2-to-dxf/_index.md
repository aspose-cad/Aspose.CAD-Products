 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert CFF2 files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load CFF2 file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of DxfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
