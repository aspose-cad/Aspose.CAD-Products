 In order to convert STL to BMP, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert STL files to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load STL file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of BmpOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of BmpOptions

```cs
// load STL in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.stl"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of BmpOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.BmpOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export STL to BMP
    image.Save("output.bmp", options);
}

STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
