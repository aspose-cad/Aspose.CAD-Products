 In order to convert DWT to DXF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert DWT files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWT file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of DxfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

```cs
// load DWT in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dwt"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of DxfOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.DxfOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DWT to DXF
    image.Save("output.dxf", options);
}

A DWT file is an AutoCAD drawing template file that is used as starter for creating drawings that can be saved as DWG files. Such template files provide initial settings such as unit types, precision required, title blocks, layer names, line types and other similar information for lateral conversion to proper drawing files. Both AutoCAD and CoreCAD can be used to read the template files and utilize them further. In simple words, a DWT is a DWG with pre-defined read-only attributes in the same way as a MSWord DOT file is to a DOC file.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="dxf" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dxf/" >}}
DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
