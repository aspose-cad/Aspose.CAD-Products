 In order to convert DGN to TIFF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert DGN files to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DGN file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of TiffOptions

```cs
// load DGN in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dgn"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of TiffOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.TiffOptions(Aspose.CAD.FileFormats.Tiff.Enums.TiffExpectedFormat.Default);

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DGN to TIFF
    image.Save("output.tiff", options);
}

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DGN" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dgn/" >}}
DGN, Design, files are drawings created by and supported by CAD applications such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It is used for creating and saving designs for construction projects such as highways, bridges, and buildings. The format is similar to Autodesk's DWG file format and is considered its competitor. DNG files can either be saved as Intergraph Standard File Format or V8 DGN. DGN can be converted to several other formats such as DWG, BMP, JPEG, PDF, GIF and others. It can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD, Bentley View and Bentley Systems MicroStation in addition to other software applications such as Corel PaintShop Photo Pro and IMSI TurboCAD Deluxe versions.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="tiff" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/" >}}
TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
