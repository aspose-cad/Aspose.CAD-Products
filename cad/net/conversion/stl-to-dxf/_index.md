 In order to convert STL to DXF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert STL files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load STL file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of DxfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

```cs
// load STL in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.stl"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of DxfOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.DxfOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export STL to DXF
    image.Save("output.dxf", options);
}

STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="dxf" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dxf/" >}}
DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
