 In order to convert IFC to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert IFC files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IFC file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of JpegOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of JpegOptions

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load IFC in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.ifc"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of JpegOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.JpegOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export IFC to JPEG
    image.Save("output.jpeg", options);
}

Files with IFC extension refer to  Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format that establishes international standards to import and export building objects and their properties. This file format provides interoperability between different software applications. Specifications for this file format are developed and maintained by buildingSMART International as its Data Standard. The ultimate objective of IFC file format is to improve communication, productivity, delivery time and quality throughout the life cycle of a building. Due to the established standards for common objects in the building industry, it reduces the loss of information during transmission from one application to another. IFC can hold data for geometry, calculation, quantities, facility management, pricing etc. for many different professions (architect, electrical, HVAC, structural, terrain etc.).

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
