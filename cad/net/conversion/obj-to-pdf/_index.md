 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert OBJ files to PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load OBJ file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of PdfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PdfOptions

```cs
// load OBJ in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.obj"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of PdfOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.PdfOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export OBJ to PDF
    image.Save("output.pdf", options);
}

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OBJ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}
OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
