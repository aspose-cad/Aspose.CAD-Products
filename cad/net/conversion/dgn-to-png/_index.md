DGN, Design, files are drawings created by and supported by CAD applications such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It is used for creating and saving designs for construction projects such as highways, bridges, and buildings. The format is similar to Autodesk's DWG file format and is considered its competitor. DNG files can either be saved as Intergraph Standard File Format or V8 DGN. DGN can be converted to several other formats such as DWG, BMP, JPEG, PDF, GIF and others. It can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD, Bentley View and Bentley Systems MicroStation in addition to other software applications such as Corel PaintShop Photo Pro and IMSI TurboCAD Deluxe versions.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
