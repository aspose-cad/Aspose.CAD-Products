 .NET programmers can easily load & convert CFF2 files to PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load CFF2 file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of PdfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PdfOptions

        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of PdfOptions
    var options = new ImageOptions.PdfOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
