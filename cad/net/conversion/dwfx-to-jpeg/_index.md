 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert DWFX files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load DWFX file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of JpegOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of JpegOptions

```cs
// load DWFX in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dwfx"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of JpegOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.JpegOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DWFX to JPEG
    image.Save("output.jpeg", options);
}

A DWFx (Design Web Format XPS) is a a formatted representation of 2D/3D drawing as XPS document. It contains graphics and text as part of design data. It is the newest version of DWF file format and can be viewed and printed with the Microsoft XPS Viewer. The XPS nature of these files lets you share the design data with reviewers without requiring them to install Autodesk Design Review. Similar to DWF, DWFx is developed by Autodesk in compressed format to make transmission over the internet suitable. A single DWFx file can contain one or multiple drawings and sheet sets.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
