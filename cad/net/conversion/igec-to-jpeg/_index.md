In order to convert IGEC to JPEG, we’ll use <a href="https://products.aspose.com/cad/net">Aspose.CAD for .NET</a> API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad">NuGet</a> package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert IGEC files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load IGEC file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of JpegOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of JpegOptions

 Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core, and PHP, VBScript, Delphi, C++ via COM Interop.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

```cs
// load IGEC in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Image.Load("template.igec"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of JpegOptions
    var options = new ImageOptions.JpegOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export IGEC to JPEG
    image.Save("output.jpeg", options);
}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
