 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert DWFX files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load DWFX file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of DxfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

```cs
// load DWFX in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dwfx"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of DxfOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.DxfOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DWFX to DXF
    image.Save("output.dxf", options);
}

A DWFx (Design Web Format XPS) is a a formatted representation of 2D/3D drawing as XPS document. It contains graphics and text as part of design data. It is the newest version of DWF file format and can be viewed and printed with the Microsoft XPS Viewer. The XPS nature of these files lets you share the design data with reviewers without requiring them to install Autodesk Design Review. Similar to DWF, DWFx is developed by Autodesk in compressed format to make transmission over the internet suitable. A single DWFx file can contain one or multiple drawings and sheet sets.

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
