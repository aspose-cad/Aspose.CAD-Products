 In order to convert DWT to BMP, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.CAD** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.CAD makes it easy for the developers to load & convert DWT files to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWT file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of BmpOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of BmpOptions

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Command" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load DWT in an instance of Image via its Load method
using (var image = Aspose.CAD.Image.Load("template.dwt"))
{
    // create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
    var rasterizationOptions = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.CadRasterizationOptions()
    {
        PageWidth = 1600,
        PageHeight = 1600
    };

    // create an instance of BmpOptions
    var options = new Aspose.CAD.ImageOptions.BmpOptions();

    // set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
    options.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;

    // export DWT to BMP
    image.Save("output.bmp", options);
} 

```

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DWT" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwt/" >}}
A DWT file is an AutoCAD drawing template file that is used as starter for creating drawings that can be saved as DWG files. Such template files provide initial settings such as unit types, precision required, title blocks, layer names, line types and other similar information for lateral conversion to proper drawing files. Both AutoCAD and CoreCAD can be used to read the template files and utilize them further. In simple words, a DWT is a DWG with pre-defined read-only attributes in the same way as a MSWord DOT file is to a DOC file.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="bmp" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
