 In order to convert STL to JPEG2000, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for JavaScript](https://products.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for JavaScript platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console. For additional information on the Javascript Framework, you can go to our [documentation site](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net/showcases/).

JavaScript programmers can easily load & convert STL files to JPEG2000 in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load STL file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of Jpeg2000Options class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of Jpeg2000Options

Aspose.CAD for JavaScript allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG2000" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/j2k/" >}}
A J2K file is an image that is compressed using the wavelet compression instead of DCT compression. This file format is used by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 2000 files. J2K files store metadata information about the image file in XML unlike .jpeg or .jpg that use the EXIF format for this purpose. J2K files support 15-bit color, alpha transparency, and lossless compression. Several commercial APIs exist to decode JPEG 2000 imags such as J2K-Codec. A J2K file can be opened on Windows OS using the standard image viewers.
