 In order to convert IGES to DXF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for JavaScript](https://products.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for JavaScript platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console. For additional information on the Javascript Framework, you can go to our [documentation site](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net/showcases/).

JavaScript programmers can easily load & convert IGES files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IGES file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of DxfOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

Aspose.CAD for JavaScript allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with .iges extension is used to exchange design information between computer-aided design (CAD) applications. IGES stands for Initial Graphics Exchange Specifications. Information exchanged using IGES includes circuit diagram, wireframe, freeform surface, or solid modeling representations. IGES finds its applications in traditional engineering drawings, models analysis, and manufacturing functions. The format can exchange both 2D or 3D design information between CAD programs. IGES files can be opened with several CAD applications such as Autodesk and CADSoftTools ABViewer. There are also several APIs available to open and convert IGES files programmatically.

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
