 In order to convert FBX to OBJ, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for JavaScript](https://products.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for JavaScript platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console. For additional information on the Javascript Framework, you can go to our [documentation site](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net/showcases/).

JavaScript programmers can easily load & convert FBX files to OBJ in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load FBX file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of ObjOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of ObjOptions

Aspose.CAD for JavaScript allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OBJ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/obj/" >}}
OBJ files are used by Wavefront’s Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format. This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.
