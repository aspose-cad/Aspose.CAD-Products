 In order to convert CF2 to CGM, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for JavaScript](https://products.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for JavaScript platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console. For additional information on the Javascript Framework, you can go to our [documentation site](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net/showcases/).

JavaScript programmers can easily load & convert CF2 files to CGM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load CF2 file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of CgmOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of CgmOptions

Aspose.CAD for JavaScript allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with .cf2 extension is a CAD file format that contains 3D package designs or other model data for die cutting. Most of the CAD/CAM machines can process and cut these files. It was created by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) to provide self-describing data storage and manipulation format that matches the structure of scientific data and applications such as statistical and numerical methods, visualization and management. With the passage of time, multiple hardware devices and software applications have been developed that recognize .cf2 files. These applications provide support for CF2 files on Mac OS and Windows Operating Systems.

Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is free, platform-independent, international standard metafile format for storing and exchanging vector graphics (2D), raster graphics, and text. CGM uses an object-oriented approach and many function provisions for image production. CGM uses these object-oriented characteristics for remolding graphical elements to render an image. A metafile contains necessary information that defines other files. In CGM, a text-based source file contains all graphical elements that can be later compiled into a binary file. Basically, CGM is a way to facilitate 2D graphical data interchange, independent from any particular platform, or device.
