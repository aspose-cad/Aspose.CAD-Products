 In order to convert DGN to EMF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for JavaScript](https://products.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for JavaScript platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console. For additional information on the Javascript Framework, you can go to our [documentation site](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net/showcases/).

JavaScript programmers can easily load & convert DGN files to EMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DGN file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of EmfOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of EmfOptions

Aspose.CAD for JavaScript allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with a .dgn (Design) extension is a drawing file created by and supported by CAD applications such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It is used for creating and saving designs for construction projects such as highways, bridges, and buildings. The format is similar to Autodesk’s DWG file format and is considered its competitor. DNG files can either be saved as Intergraph Standard File Format or V8 DGN. DGN can be converted to several other formats such as DWG, BMP, JPEG, PDF, GIF and others. It can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD, Bentley View and Bentley Systems MicroStation in addition to other software applications such as Corel PaintShop Photo Pro and IMSI TurboCAD Deluxe versions.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}
Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
