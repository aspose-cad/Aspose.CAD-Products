 In order to convert DWG to DICOM, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for JavaScript](https://products.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for JavaScript platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console. For additional information on the Javascript Framework, you can go to our [documentation site](https://docs.aspose.com/cad/javascript-net/showcases/).

JavaScript programmers can easily load & convert DWG files to DICOM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWG file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of DicomOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DicomOptions

Aspose.CAD for JavaScript allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk’s free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
