In order to convert PLT to DWF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert PLT files to DWF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load PLT file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of DwfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DwfOptions

Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

The PLT file format is a vector-based plotter file introduced by Autodesk, Inc. and contains information for a certain CAD file. Plotting details require accuracy and precision in production, and usage of PLT file guarantee this as all images are printed using lines instead of dots. The format is based on the HPGL file format which is used for sending information to plotter printers. PLT files can be viewed with its original applications i.e. Autodesk’s AutoCAD, but there are other applications as well that can be used to manipulate these files such as CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. A number of applications and APIs support conversion of PLT file format to DXF, PDF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, CGM, SVG, PS and PCL.

Design Web Format (DWF) represents 2D/3D drawing in compressed format for viewing, reviewing or printing design files. It contains graphics and text as part of design data and reduce the size of the file due to its compressed format. The reduced file size makes the distribution and communication of rich design data efficient. DWF doesn’t require the recipient to know about the usage of CAD software that created the original drawing. The contents of DWF file format can be simple and include just a single sheet or complex enough to have fonts, color, and images.
