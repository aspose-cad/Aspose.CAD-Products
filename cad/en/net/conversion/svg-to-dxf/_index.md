In order to convert SVG to DXF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert SVG files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load SVG file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of DxfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

An SVG file is a Scalar Vector Graphics file that uses XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for building a website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
