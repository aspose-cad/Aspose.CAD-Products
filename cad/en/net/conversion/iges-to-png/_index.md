In order to convert IGES to PNG, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert IGES files to PNG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load IGES file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of PngOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PngOptions

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with .iges extension is used to exchange design information between computer-aided design (CAD) applications. IGES stands for Initial Graphics Exchange Specifications. Information exchanged using IGES includes circuit diagram, wireframe, freeform surface, or solid modeling representations. IGES finds its applications in traditional engineering drawings, models analysis, and manufacturing functions. The format can exchange both 2D or 3D design information between CAD programs. IGES files can be opened with several CAD applications such as Autodesk and CADSoftTools ABViewer. There are also several APIs available to open and convert IGES files programmatically.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PNG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/" >}}
A PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file is a raster image file format that uses lossless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports lossless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the widely used image file formats.
