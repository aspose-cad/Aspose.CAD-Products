 .NET programmers can easily load & convert CF2 files to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load CF2 file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of GifOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of GifOptions

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
