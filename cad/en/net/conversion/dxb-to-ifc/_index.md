In order to convert DXB to IFC, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert DXB files to IFC in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load DXB file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of IfcOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of IfcOptions

Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

DXB stands for Drawing Exchange Binary, which is a file format used in computer-aided design (CAD) software. DXB files contain binary data that represent 2D vector graphics and are used to exchange drawings between different CAD programs. They are typically created by exporting drawing from CAD program in DXB format and then importing it into another CAD program. DXB format is less commonly used today than other CAD file formats like DXF or DWG. However, some older CAD programs may still use DXB as file format for exporting or importing drawings.If you have DXB file and need to view or edit it, you will need CAD program that supports DXB format. Some examples of CAD programs that support DXB include AutoCAD, DraftSight and LibreCAD.

Files with IFC extension refer to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format that establishes international standards to import and export building objects and their properties. This file format provides interoperability between different software applications. Specifications for this file format are developed and maintained by buildingSMART International as its Data Standard. The ultimate objective of IFC file format is to improve communication, productivity, delivery time and quality throughout the life cycle of a building. Due to the established standards for common objects in the building industry, it reduces the loss of information during transmission from one application to another. IFC can hold data for geometry, calculation, quantities, facility management, pricing etc. for many different professions (architect, electrical, HVAC, structural, terrain etc.).
