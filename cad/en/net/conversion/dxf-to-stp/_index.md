In order to convert DXF to STP, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

```cs

PM> Install-Package Aspose.CAD

```

.NET programmers can easily load & convert DXF files to STP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load DXF file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of StpOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of StpOptions

Before running the .NET conversion code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.CAD for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="STP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/stp/" >}}
An STP file is a 3D CAD file used for exchange of product data between CAD and CAM applications. It contains information about 3D objects and is saved similar to the STEP file format. STP files facilitate the exchange of data between applications as per the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx. This ISO defines the encoding mechanism for data representation in EXPRESS data modeling language. STP files can be opened in applications such as such as Autodesk Fusion 360.
