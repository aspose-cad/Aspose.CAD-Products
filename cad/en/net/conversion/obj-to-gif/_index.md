In order to convert OBJ to GIF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET programmers can easily load & convert OBJ files to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load OBJ file with Image.Load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of GifOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of GifOptions

OBJ files are used by Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer application to define and store the geometric objects. Backward and forward transmission of geometric data is made possible through OBJ files. Both polygonal geometry like points, lines, texture vertices, faces and free-form geometry (curves and surfaces) are supported by OBJ format.  This format does not support animation or information related to light and position of scenes. An OBJ file is usually an end product of the 3D modeling process generated by a CAD (Computer Aided Design). The default order to store vertices is counter-clockwise avoiding explicit declaration of face normals. Though OBJ files declare scale information in a comment line yet no units have been declared for OBJ coordinates.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
