In order to convert DWG to FBX, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert DWG files to FBX in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load DWG file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of FbxOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of FbxOptions

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk’s free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was originally developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D exchange formats as used by many 3D tools. FBX is available in both binary and ASCII file format. The format was established to provided interoperability between digital content creation applications. There are many tools available for conversion from/to FBX file format.
