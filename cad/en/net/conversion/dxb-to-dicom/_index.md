In order to convert DXB to DICOM, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert DXB files to DICOM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load DXB file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of DicomOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DicomOptions

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

DXB stands for Drawing Exchange Binary, which is a file format used in computer-aided design (CAD) software. DXB files contain binary data that represent 2D vector graphics and are used to exchange drawings between different CAD programs. They are typically created by exporting drawing from CAD program in DXB format and then importing it into another CAD program. DXB format is less commonly used today than other CAD file formats like DXF or DWG. However, some older CAD programs may still use DXB as file format for exporting or importing drawings.If you have DXB file and need to view or edit it, you will need CAD program that supports DXB format. Some examples of CAD programs that support DXB include AutoCAD, DraftSight and LibreCAD.

DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
