In order to convert CF2 to PDF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cad/net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

.NET programmers can easily load & convert CF2 files to PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load CF2 file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of PdfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PdfOptions

Aspose.CAD for .NET allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with .cf2 extension is a CAD file format that contains 3D package designs or other model data for die cutting. Most of the CAD/CAM machines can process and cut these files. It was created by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) to provide self-describing data storage and manipulation format that matches the structure of scientific data and applications such as statistical and numerical methods, visualization and management. With the passage of time, multiple hardware devices and software applications have been developed that recognize .cf2 files. These applications provide support for CF2 files on Mac OS and Windows Operating Systems.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. The PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
