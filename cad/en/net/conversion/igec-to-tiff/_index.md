 .NET programmers can easily load & convert IGEC files to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load IGEC file with Image.Load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of TiffOptions

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
