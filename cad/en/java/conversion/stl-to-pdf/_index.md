 In order to render STL to PDF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Aspose Maven Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/cad/) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert STL file to PDF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load STL file with Image.load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of PdfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PdfOptions

 It is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="STL" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/stl/" >}}

STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. The file format finds its usage in several fields such as rapid prototyping, 3D printing and computer-aided manufacturing. It represents a surface as a series of small triangles, known as facets, where each facet is described by a perpendicular direction and three points representing the vertices of the triangle. Resultant data is used by applications to determine the cross section of the 3D shape to be built by the fabber. There is no information available in the STL file format for representation of colour, texture or other common CAD model attributes.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
