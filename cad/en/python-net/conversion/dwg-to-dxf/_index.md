 In order to convert DWG to DXF, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert DWG files to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWG file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of DxfOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk’s free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
