 In order to convert DWT to GLB, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

```py

pip install aspose-cad

```

Python programmers can easily load & convert DWT files to GLB in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWT file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of GlbOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of GlbOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A DWT file is an AutoCAD drawing template file that is used as starter for creating drawings that can be saved as DWG files. Such template files provide initial settings such as unit types, precision required, title blocks, layer names, line types and other similar information for lateral conversion to proper drawing files. Both AutoCAD and CoreCAD can be used to read the template files and utilize them further. In simple words, a DWT is a DWG with pre-defined read-only attributes in the same way as a MSWord DOT file is to a DOC file.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GLB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/glb/" >}}
GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.
