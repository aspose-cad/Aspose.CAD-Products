 In order to convert DXB to BMP, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert DXB files to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DXB file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of BmpOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of BmpOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

DXB stands for Drawing Exchange Binary, which is a file format used in computer-aided design (CAD) software. DXB files contain binary data that represent 2D vector graphics and are used to exchange drawings between different CAD programs. They are typically created by exporting drawing from CAD program in DXB format and then importing it into another CAD program. DXB format is less commonly used today than other CAD file formats like DXF or DWG. However, some older CAD programs may still use DXB as file format for exporting or importing drawings.If you have DXB file and need to view or edit it, you will need CAD program that supports DXB format. Some examples of CAD programs that support DXB include AutoCAD, DraftSight and LibreCAD.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
