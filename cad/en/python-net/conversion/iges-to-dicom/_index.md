 In order to convert IGES to DICOM, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert IGES files to DICOM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IGES file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of DicomOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DicomOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with .iges extension is used to exchange design information between computer-aided design (CAD) applications. IGES stands for Initial Graphics Exchange Specifications. Information exchanged using IGES includes circuit diagram, wireframe, freeform surface, or solid modeling representations. IGES finds its applications in traditional engineering drawings, models analysis, and manufacturing functions. The format can exchange both 2D or 3D design information between CAD programs. IGES files can be opened with several CAD applications such as Autodesk and CADSoftTools ABViewer. There are also several APIs available to open and convert IGES files programmatically.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DICOM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/dicom/" >}}
DICOM is the acronym for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. DICOM is used for the integration of medical imaging devices like printers, servers, scanners etc from various vendors and also contains identification data of each patient for uniqueness. DICOM files can be shared between two parties if they are capable of receiving image data in DICOM format. The communication part of DICOM is application layer protocol and uses TCP/IP to communicate between entities. Versions supported by web services are 1.0, 1.1, 2 or later.
