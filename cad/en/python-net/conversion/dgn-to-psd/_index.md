 In order to convert DGN to PSD, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert DGN files to PSD in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DGN file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of PsdOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PsdOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

A file with a .dgn (Design) extension is a drawing file created by and supported by CAD applications such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It is used for creating and saving designs for construction projects such as highways, bridges, and buildings. The format is similar to Autodesk’s DWG file format and is considered its competitor. DNG files can either be saved as Intergraph Standard File Format or V8 DGN. DGN can be converted to several other formats such as DWG, BMP, JPEG, PDF, GIF and others. It can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD, Bentley View and Bentley Systems MicroStation in addition to other software applications such as Corel PaintShop Photo Pro and IMSI TurboCAD Deluxe versions.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PSD" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/psd/" >}}
PSD, Photoshop Document, represents Adobe Photoshop’s native file format used for graphics designing and development. PSD files may include image layers, adjustment layers, layer masks, annotations, file information, keywords and other Photoshop-specific elements. Photoshop files have default extension as .PSD and has a maximum height and width of 30,000 pixels, and a length limit of two gigabytes.
