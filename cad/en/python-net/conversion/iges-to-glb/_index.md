 In order to convert IGES to GLB, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert IGES files to GLB in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IGES file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of GlbOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of GlbOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="IGES" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/iges/" >}}
A file with .iges extension is used to exchange design information between computer-aided design (CAD) applications. IGES stands for Initial Graphics Exchange Specifications. Information exchanged using IGES includes circuit diagram, wireframe, freeform surface, or solid modeling representations. IGES finds its applications in traditional engineering drawings, models analysis, and manufacturing functions. The format can exchange both 2D or 3D design information between CAD programs. IGES files can be opened with several CAD applications such as Autodesk and CADSoftTools ABViewer. There are also several APIs available to open and convert IGES files programmatically.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GLB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/glb/" >}}
GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.
