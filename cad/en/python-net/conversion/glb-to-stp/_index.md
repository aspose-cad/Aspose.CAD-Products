 In order to convert GLB to STP, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert GLB files to STP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load GLB file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of StpOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of StpOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="STP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/stp/" >}}
An STP file is a 3D CAD file used for exchange of product data between CAD and CAM applications. It contains information about 3D objects and is saved similar to the STEP file format. STP files facilitate the exchange of data between applications as per the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx. This ISO defines the encoding mechanism for data representation in EXPRESS data modeling language. STP files can be opened in applications such as such as Autodesk Fusion 360.
