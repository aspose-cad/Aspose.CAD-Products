 In order to convert CGM to SVG, we’ll use [Aspose.CAD for Python](https://products.aspose.com/cad/python-net) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python platform. Open [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aspose-cad) package manager, search for Aspose.CAD and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

Python programmers can easily load & convert CGM files to SVG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load CGM file with Image.Load method
1.  Create an instance of SvgOptions class
1.  Call Image.Save method while passing the resultant file path & object of SvgOptions

Aspose.CAD for Python allows you to read, manipulate, process and export any CAD or BIM drawing file into various vector and raster formats without using AutoCAD or any other additional software. It's multi-thread safe, cross-OS compatible, allows you to track export progress, and handle individual layers and layouts. Developers can select and convert specific layouts and layers from AutoCAD files and easily track the file conversion process.

Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is free, platform-independent, international standard metafile format for storing and exchanging vector graphics (2D), raster graphics, and text. CGM uses an object-oriented approach and many function provisions for image production. CGM uses these object-oriented characteristics for remolding graphical elements to render an image. A metafile contains necessary information that defines other files. In CGM, a text-based source file contains all graphical elements that can be later compiled into a binary file. Basically, CGM is a way to facilitate 2D graphical data interchange, independent from any particular platform, or device.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SVG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/svg/" >}}
An SVG file is a Scalar Vector Graphics file that uses XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for building a website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
