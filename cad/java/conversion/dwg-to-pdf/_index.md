 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation.

```cs

// load DWG in an instance of Image via its Load method
Image image = Image.load("template.dwg");

// create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

// create an instance of PdfOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

// export DWG to PDF
image.save("output.pdf", options);

Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk's free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
