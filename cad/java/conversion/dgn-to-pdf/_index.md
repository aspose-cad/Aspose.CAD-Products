rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);

// create an instance of PdfOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

DGN, Design, files are drawings created by and supported by CAD applications such as MicroStation and Intergraph Interactive Graphics Design System. It is used for creating and saving designs for construction projects such as highways, bridges, and buildings. The format is similar to Autodesk's DWG file format and is considered its competitor. DNG files can either be saved as Intergraph Standard File Format or V8 DGN. DGN can be converted to several other formats such as DWG, BMP, JPEG, PDF, GIF and others. It can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD, Bentley View and Bentley Systems MicroStation in addition to other software applications such as Corel PaintShop Photo Pro and IMSI TurboCAD Deluxe versions.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
