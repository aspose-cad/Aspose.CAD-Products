 In order to render IFC to PNG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.CAD API makes it easy for the developers to convert IFC file to PNG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IFC file with Image.load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of PngOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PngOptions

```cs
// load IFC in an instance of Image via its Load method
Image image = Image.load("template.ifc");

// create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

// create an instance of PngOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

// export IFC to PNG
image.save("output.png", options);

Files with IFC extension refer to  Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format that establishes international standards to import and export building objects and their properties. This file format provides interoperability between different software applications. Specifications for this file format are developed and maintained by buildingSMART International as its Data Standard. The ultimate objective of IFC file format is to improve communication, productivity, delivery time and quality throughout the life cycle of a building. Due to the established standards for common objects in the building industry, it reduces the loss of information during transmission from one application to another. IFC can hold data for geometry, calculation, quantities, facility management, pricing etc. for many different professions (architect, electrical, HVAC, structural, terrain etc.).

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
