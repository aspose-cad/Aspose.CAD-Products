 In order to render DWG to PNG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.CAD API makes it easy for the developers to convert DWG file to PNG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWG file with Image.load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of PngOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of PngOptions

// create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

// create an instance of PngOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

// export DWG to PNG
image.save("output.png", options);

Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk's free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PNG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/" >}}

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
