 In order to render IFC to GIF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.CAD API makes it easy for the developers to convert IFC file to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load IFC file with Image.load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of GifOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of GifOptions

```cs
// load IFC in an instance of Image via its Load method
Image image = Image.load("template.ifc");

// create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

// create an instance of GifOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

// export IFC to GIF
image.save("output.gif", options);

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. ‎

Files with IFC extension refer to  Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format that establishes international standards to import and export building objects and their properties. This file format provides interoperability between different software applications. Specifications for this file format are developed and maintained by buildingSMART International as its Data Standard. The ultimate objective of IFC file format is to improve communication, productivity, delivery time and quality throughout the life cycle of a building. Due to the established standards for common objects in the building industry, it reduces the loss of information during transmission from one application to another. IFC can hold data for geometry, calculation, quantities, facility management, pricing etc. for many different professions (architect, electrical, HVAC, structural, terrain etc.).

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GIF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/" >}}

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
