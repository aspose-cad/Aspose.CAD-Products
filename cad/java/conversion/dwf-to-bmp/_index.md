 In order to render DWF to BMP, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.CAD API makes it easy for the developers to convert DWF file to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWF file with Image.load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of BmpOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of BmpOptions

```cs
// load DWF in an instance of Image via its Load method
Image image = Image.load("template.dwf");

// create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

// create an instance of BmpOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

// export DWF to BMP
image.save("output.bmp", options);

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DWF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dwf/" >}}

Design Web Format (DWF) represents 2D/3D drawing in compressed format for viewing, reviewing or printing design files. It contains graphics and text as part of design data and reduce the size of the file due to its compressed format. The reduced file size makes the distribution and communication of rich design data efficient. DWF doesn't require the recipient to know about the usage of CAD software that created the original drawing. The contents of DWF file format can be simple and include just a single sheet or complex enough to have fonts, color, and images.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
