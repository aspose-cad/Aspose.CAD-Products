 Aspose.CAD API makes it easy for the developers to convert CFF2 file to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load CFF2 file with Image.load method
1. Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1. Create an instance of BmpOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1. Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of BmpOptions

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
