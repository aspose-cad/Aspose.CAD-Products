 In order to render DWT to DXF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.CAD API makes it easy for the developers to convert DWT file to DXF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load DWT file with Image.load method
1.  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height & width
1.  Create an instance of DxfOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
1.  Call Image.save method while passing the resultant file path & object of DxfOptions

// create an instance of CadRasterizationOptions and set page height & width
CadRasterizationOptions rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.setPageWidth(1600);
rasterizationOptions.setPageHeight(1600);

// create an instance of DxfOptions
TiffOptions options = new TiffOptions();

// set the VectorRasterizationOptions property as CadRasterizationOptions
options.setVectorRasterizationOptions(rasterizationOptions);

// export DWT to DXF
image.save("output.dxf", options);

 Aspose.CAD is an AutoCAD conversion API. One can easily convert DWG, DWF, DGN and DXF documents to PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG and other image formats. Moreover, API provides conversion facility of specific layouts and layers from the AutoCAD documents. Its a standalone API and does not require AutoCAD or any other software installation. ‎

A DWT file is an AutoCAD drawing template file that is used as starter for creating drawings that can be saved as DWG files. Such template files provide initial settings such as unit types, precision required, title blocks, layer names, line types and other similar information for lateral conversion to proper drawing files. Both AutoCAD and CoreCAD can be used to read the template files and utilize them further. In simple words, a DWT is a DWG with pre-defined read-only attributes in the same way as a MSWord DOT file is to a DOC file.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="DXF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/dxf/" >}}

DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
