In order to view DWG file, we’ll use
[Aspose.CAD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cad/java) 
API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use image manipulation and conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
[Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cad) 
and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

You need the
 [aspose-cad-version-jdk16.jar](https://downloads.aspose.com/cad/java) 
 to try the following workflow in your own environment.

+  Load DWG file with Image.Load method
+  Set an object of CadRasterizationOptions with page height and width
+  Create an instance of TiffOptions class and set its VectorRasterizationOptions property
+  Call Image.Save method with object of TiffOptions
+  Call Process.Start with path to resultant image to load it in default application

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.CAD for Java API" %}}


Aspose.CAD API is an image processing solution to create, modify, draw or convert images (photos) within applications. It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), modifications such as drawing, working with graphic primitives, transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, binarization, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, dithering, masking, deskewing), and memory optimization strategies. It’s a standalone library and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with native APIs within projects. These are 100% private on-premise APIs and images are processed at your servers.

Files with DWG extension represent proprietary binary files used for containing 2D and 3D design data. Like DXF, which are ASCII files, DWG represent the binary file format for CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings. It contains vector image and metadata for representation of contents of CAD files. There are free viewers available for viewing DWG files on Windows Operating System such as the Autodesk’s free DWG TrueView. There are other third party applications as well that support reaching DWG files.
